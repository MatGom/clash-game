# Clash Game
## A Strategic Game for Two Players

### Welcome
Clash Game is designed for two players. This project was created using React, with state management through `useState` and React Redux. 

### Game Overview
- **Starting Point**: Each player starts with 1000 gold and can spend up to 100 gold each turn.
- **What You Own**: Every player has a castle and three military camps.

### How to Play
- **Turns**: Players take turns, starting with player one. 
- **Actions**: Upgrade your castle to increase gold income and spending limit, or train units in your camps to boost their attack and defense.
- **Battle Phase**: After both players have taken their turns, the battle phase reveals all camp stats for a showdown.

### Winning the Game
- **Camp Clashes**: Win a camp clash by having higher attack than the opponent's defense.
- **Scoring**: Win more camp clashes than your opponent to win the battle phase. The game ends after 10 turns, and the player with the most gold wins.
